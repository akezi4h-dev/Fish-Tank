## AI 201 — ESF Documentation

### AI Direction Log

**Project:** Tide Lines — AI 201 Project 2
**Format:** Each entry names the prompt given, what AI produced, what was changed, and why.

---

#### Entry 1 — Domain & Concept Direction

**Session:** Project kickoff
**What I asked:** I told Claude the domain was "my github repo" before clarifying. When I clarified, I said I was going to write a design intent document tonight.
**What AI did:** Claude correctly paused and waited. It did not generate a domain concept on its own or try to interpret "my GitHub repo" as a theme. It asked clarifying questions: was it a portfolio viewer of my repos, or something about this specific repo?
**What I did instead:** I came back with a fully personal design intent — *Tide Lines*, a shared fish tank where each fish is a message from someone you love, rooted in my experience as an international student. The fish metaphor came from me, the name "Tide Lines" came from me, the emotional framing ("connection feels ambient, not obligatory") came from me.
**Why it matters:** The assignment says to be the Art Director of a system. I didn't let AI generate the concept. The domain is personal and specific to my life — AI couldn't have invented it.

#### Entry 2 — Build Order Enforcement

**Session:** After design intent was submitted
**What I asked:** I gave Claude the full spec and said: *"Build it one component at a time, starting with the data model and parent state."*
**What AI produced:** Claude built only the parent App component with the full useState shape and mock data — no UI, no components, just state and handlers. It explicitly returned `null` from the render.
**What I did:** I approved this and said "yes" to proceed to Screen 1.
**Why it matters:** The assignment explicitly warns that AI will try to build all three panels at once and make architectural decisions you didn't approve. I enforced the build order: parent state → Screen 1 → Screen 2 → Screen 3. Each step required my explicit go-ahead. Claude did not deviate from this sequence.

---

#### Entry 3 — Fish Type Connection (Caught and Directed)

**Session:** After all three screens were built
**What AI produced:** Claude built `TankView.jsx` with its own internal `FishSVG({ color })` component that rendered a single hardcoded generic fish shape — an ellipse + triangle tail + eye. The `fish.type` field from state was passed into the fish object but was never read in the tank renderer. Every fish in Screen 2 looked identical regardless of type.
**What I asked Claude to show me:** *"Show me where in the code the fish type from state is being used to determine what renders in the tank. If it's not connected, fix it."*
**What I directed:** I caught the disconnection and directed Claude to extract all fish shapes into a shared `FishSVGs.jsx` file, export a single `FishSVG` component that takes both `type` and `color` as props, and use it in both TankView and AddFishModal. Both screens now import from the same source.
**Why it matters:** This is the exact failure mode the assignment warns about — AI builds something that looks connected but the data isn't actually flowing. `fish.type` was in state. It just wasn't being read. I caught it and directed the architectural fix.

#### Entry 4 — Custom Artwork Over AI-Generated SVGs

**Session:** After fish type fix
**What AI produced:** Claude had generated five hand-coded SVG fish (clownfish, angelfish, betta, goldfish, pufferfish) using basic geometric shapes — ellipses, polygons, lines. They were functional but generic. The AI designed them from scratch with no reference to my visual intent.
**What I did:** I had my own custom SVG artwork in the repo folder (`Untitled (4)/`): Angel Fish, Clownfish, Eel, Lion Fish, Otter, Puffer Fish, Seal, Shark, Turtle — 9 files. I directed Claude to replace the AI-generated SVGs entirely with my artwork.
**What changed:** The AI's geometric fish shapes were deleted. All 9 custom files were moved to `src/assets/fish/`, imported into `FishSVGs.jsx`, and the `FishSVG` component was rewritten to render `<img>` tags pointing to my files. The color slider still applies `hue-rotate` on top of the real artwork.
**Why it matters:** Visual direction is mine. AI generated placeholder shapes because it had nothing else to work with. When I had real assets, I replaced the placeholders. The final app reflects my artwork, not Claude's geometric approximations.

---

#### Entry 5 — Expanding Fish Types (9 vs 5)

**Session:** Same session as custom artwork
**What AI assumed:** The original spec and the AddFishModal were built for exactly 5 fish types — clownfish, angelfish, betta, goldfish, pufferfish — matching the spec I provided.
**What I directed:** When I brought in my custom SVG folder, I had 9 files, not 5. I explicitly asked: *"can i add all the images and the types to the modal selector."* I directed expanding FISH_TYPES from 5 to all 9: clownfish, angelfish, eel, lionfish, otter, pufferfish, seal, shark, turtle.
**What changed:** `FISH_TYPES` array in `FishSVGs.jsx` expanded. The modal selector now arrows through all 9. The tank can render all 9 types.
**Why it matters:** The final creative scope of the species in the tank is my decision. AI had no knowledge of the Otter, Seal, Shark, Turtle, or Eel until I surfaced the files. I defined what belongs in this tank.

### Records of Resistance

**Format:** Each entry names the AI output, why it was wrong or insufficient, and what was done instead.

---

#### Resistance 1 — AI Duplicated Fish Shape Logic Across Two Components

**What AI gave me:**
When Claude built AddFishModal (Screen 3), it defined five fish SVG functions inside the modal file itself — `ClownfishSVG`, `AngelfishSVG`, `BettaSVG`, `GoldfishSVG`, `PufferfishSVG` — and used them only in the modal. Separately, TankView (Screen 2) had its own internal `FishSVG` component that was a completely different generic shape. The same concept — "render a fish" — existed in two places with two different implementations.

**Why I rejected it:**
This is exactly the duplication problem the assignment is built to teach against. The assignment's architectural rule is single source of truth. Having fish rendering logic in two places means if I change one, the other doesn't update. It also means the fish in the modal selector and the fish in the tank would never match — which is exactly what happened: users picked a clownfish in the modal and saw a generic blob in the tank.

**What I did instead:**
I directed Claude to extract all fish shapes into a single shared file, `src/components/FishSVGs.jsx`, and export one `FishSVG` component that both TankView and AddFishModal import. The fish type and color flow through props. One file. One component. Both screens use it.

---

#### Resistance 2 — AI Used Generic Placeholder Fish in Screen 1 Preview

**What AI gave me:**
The first version of `TankPreview` in `TankGrid.jsx` rendered an SVG tank with hardcoded generic fish shapes inside — a fixed ellipse body, polygon tail, and eye, drawn directly in the SVG using SVG coordinate transforms. These preview fish had no connection to `fish.type` or `fish.color` from state. They were decorative placeholders: every tank card showed the same orange fish regardless of what was actually in the tank.

**Why I rejected it:**
The design intent says the tank is a living preview of messages from real people. If Mom sent a clownfish and Leo sent a goldfish, the tank card on Screen 1 should show a clownfish and a goldfish — not two identical generic blobs. The preview needs to reflect actual state. Showing wrong fish breaks the user's mental model of what's inside the tank before they even open it.

**What I did instead:**
I directed Claude to replace the hardcoded SVG fish with real `FishSVG` components from `FishSVGs.jsx`, using `fish.type` and `fish.color` from `tank.fish.slice(-3)`. The preview now shows the 3 most recent actual fish at ~40% scale with idle swim animations. The Add New Tank card was explicitly kept empty — no fish, ever.

#### Resistance 3 — AI's Generated SVG Artwork Was Not My Visual Direction

**What AI gave me:**
Before I provided my custom SVG files, Claude generated its own fish illustrations using basic SVG geometry: ellipses for bodies, polygons for tails, lines for stripes, circles for eyes. The clownfish was an orange ellipse with white stripe ellipses overlaid. The angelfish was a diamond shape. The betta was a purple ellipse with path fins. These were functional but they were AI-invented visual designs — not mine.

**Why I rejected it:**
My design intent specifies a visual mood: deep ocean, atmospheric, bioluminescent. The AI-generated fish were generic geometric approximations with no relationship to that mood or to any actual fish illustration style. More importantly, I had already created custom SVG artwork. AI did not know this artwork existed. The placeholder shapes had no place in the final product.

**What I did instead:**
I surfaced my custom artwork from `Untitled (4)/` — 9 SVG files I had designed. I directed Claude to copy them into `src/assets/fish/`, import them into `FishSVGs.jsx`, and replace the AI geometry with `<img>` tags pointing to my files. The `hue-rotate` filter was preserved so the color slider still works on top of my artwork. Every fish the user sees in this app — in the modal, in the tank, in the preview cards — is my illustration, not Claude's.
